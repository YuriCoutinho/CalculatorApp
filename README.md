# CalculatorApp

![CalculatorApp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/your-image-path)

**CalculatorApp** is a simple web application that functions as a calculator. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project was developed as a personal project to strengthen my knowledge of **Webpack5**, **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **JavaScript**.

## Motivation üîç
The main motivation for this project was to improve my understanding of Webpack5 and how it can be used to manage and bundle web application assets. Additionally, I wanted to practice writing Sass/SCSS using BEM (Block Element Modify) and the 7-1 Patterns Architecture, and incorporate these best practices to create reusable and modular CSS.

## Technologies Used ‚öôÔ∏è
- HTML5
- CSS3
